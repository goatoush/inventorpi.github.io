# Potentiometer and Servo

![Potentiometer and Servo](/assets/images/circuits/Potentiometer%20and%20Servo%20Circuit.jpg)

{: .summary }
### A MicroPython code example running on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W microcontroller connected to a micro servo motor, a potentiometer (rotation sensor) module and an OLED display module (SSD1306) on a breadboard to control the angle of the servo by rotating the potentiometer knob and display the angle on the OLED display

Potentiometers are the dials we turn to control things like temperature or volume. They work by varying the electrical resistance, which we read as varying voltage at a microcontroller's input pin. In this script, we use this input to control a servo angle.

A servo is a motor where we can control the rotation angle by changing the PWM signal we send to it. Unlike standard electric motors that spin continuously, a servo motor moves to an exact angle or position and holds it firmly.

Create a new file in Thonny, with file name potentiometer_and_servo.py. Copy and paste the code below into the file you created.

```python
print("\nPotentiometer and Servo")

# DESCRIPTION

# Potentiometers are the dials we turn to control things like temperature or volume.
# They work by varying the electrical resistance, which we read as varying voltage at a
# microcontroller's input pin. In this script, we use this input to control a servo angle.

# A servo is a motor where we can control the rotation angle by changing the PWM 
# signal we send to it. Unlike standard electric motors that spin continuously, 
# a servo motor moves to an exact angle or position and holds it firmly.

# CONNECTIONS REQUIRED

# Connect Potentiometer module (labeled 'Rotation Sensor')
#   Pins: GND => GND, VCC => VCC, S => GP28
# Connect Servo
#   Pins: Brown: GND, Red: VCC, Yellow: GP9
