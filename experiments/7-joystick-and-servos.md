# Joystick and Servos

![Joystick and Servos](/assets/images/circuits/Joystick%20and%20Servos%20Circuit.jpg)

{: #summary }
### A MicroPython code example running on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W microcontroller connected to an analog 2-axis thumb joystick module, 2 micro servo motors and an OLED display module (SSD1306) on a breadboard to control the angles of both servos using the joystick and display the angles on the OLED display

A joystick is often used for navigation in robots, drones, cruise ships and planes. In FRC robotics, we use 2 gaming controllers, with 2 joysticks per controller. Each joystick includes independent X and Y axis control. Which  gives us a total of 8 independent axes to control the robot.

In this script, we control the angle of two servos using different axes of the joystick. By pressing the joystick button, we toggle the mode to Sync Angle Mode. Now we use trigonometry to calculate the angle the joystick lever makes, and set the servos to match this angle. In robotics, we often use advanced mathematics to control various motions.

A servo is a motor where we can control the rotation angle by changing the PWM signal we send to it. Unlike standard electric motors that spin continuously, a servo motor moves to an exact angle or position and holds it firmly.

Create a new file in Thonny, with file name joystick_and_servos.py. Copy and paste the code below into the file you created.

# DESCRIPTION

# A joystick is often used for navigation in robots, drones, cruise ships and planes. 
# In FRC robotics, we use 2 gaming controllers, with 2 joysticks per controller. 
# Each joystick includes independent X and Y axis control. Which  gives us a total 
# of 8 independent axes to control the robot.

# In this script, we control the angle of two servos using different axes of the joystick.
# By pressing the joystick button, we toggle the mode to Sync Angle Mode. Now we 
# use trigonometry to calculate the angle the joystick lever makes, and set the servos to match 
# this angle. In robotics, we often use advanced mathematics to control various motions.

# A servo is a motor where we can control the rotation angle by changing the PWM 
# signal we send to it. Unlike standard electric motors that spin continuously, 
# a servo motor moves to an exact angle or position and holds it firmly.
