# Distance Sensor

![Distance Sensor](/assets/images/circuits/Distance%20Sensor%20Circuit.jpg)

A distance sensor measures the distance to any nearby obstruction. Robots and cars use such sensors to stop before hitting any obstruction. The sensor used here is an ultrasonic distance sensor. We convert the distance to different RGB colors and buzzer frequencies to create a fun musical instrument that you can play with hand gestures. We also change the angle of a servo motor based on the distance detected. 

A servo is a motor where we can control the rotation angle by changing the PWM signal we send to it. Unlike standard electric motors that spin continuously, a servo motor moves to an exact angle or position and holds it firmly.

Create a new file in Thonny, with file name distance_sensor.py. Copy and paste the code below into the file you created.

```python
print("\nDistance Sensor")

# We convert the distance to different RGB colors and buzzer frequencies
# to create a fun musical instrument that you can play with hand gestures.
# We also change the angle of a servo motor based on the distance detected.

# CONNECTIONS REQUIRED

# Connect HC-SR04 module
#   Pins: VCC => VCC, Trig => GP19, Echo => GP18, GND => GND
# Connect Servo
#   Pins: Brown: GND, Red: VCC, Yellow: GP9
