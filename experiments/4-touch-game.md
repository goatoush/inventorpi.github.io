# Touch Game

![Touch Game](/assets/images/circuits/Touch%20Game%20Circuit.jpg)

A capacitive touch sensor detects a touch by measuring changes in electrical charge when a human finger comes close. Humans are full of water and salt, making the body a natural conductor of electricity. It is used in smartphones for multi-touch navigation and gesture detection. In this script, we create a short game to test your reaction time, while also learning how to draw shapes on the OLED screen.

To read the sensor, we run:

```python
from time import sleep
from machine import Pin

touch_sensor = Pin(28, Pin.IN)

while True:
    if touch_sensor.value() == 1:
        print("Touch Detected")
        while touch_sensor.value() == 1: pass # wait until touch is not detected
    print("No Touch")
```

For this game, we learn to draw on the OLED screen, using oled.display.ellipse to draw a circle, and oled.display.fill_rect to draw a rectangle. The function below draws happy or sad face based on the parameters passed to it.

```python
def draw_face(text_line_1 = "", text_line_2 = "", happy = False, sad = False, inverted = False):
    center_x = 64
    center_y = 42
    face_radius = 20
    color = 0 if inverted else 1 # default white color, black if inverted == True
    oled.display.fill(0)
    oled.display.text(text_line_1, 0, 0) # line 1 text
    oled.display.text(text_line_2, 0, 56) # line 2 text
    oled.display.ellipse(center_x, center_y, face_radius, face_radius, 1, color == 0) # face circle
    oled.display.ellipse(center_x - 7, center_y - 8, 1, 1, color, True) # left eye
    oled.display.ellipse(center_x + 7, center_y - 8, 1, 1, color, True) # right eye
    if happy:
        oled.display.ellipse(center_x, center_y, 10, 10, color, False, 0x4 | 0x8) # happy face semi-circle
        oled.display.fill_rect(center_x - 11, center_y, 22, 5, 1 - color) # erase part of semi-circle
    elif sad:
        oled.display.ellipse(center_x, center_y + 14, 10, 10, color, False, 0x1 | 0x2) # sad face semi-circle
        oled.display.fill_rect(center_x - 11, center_y + 10, 22, 5, 1 - color) # erase part of semi-circle
    else:
        oled.display.hline(center_x - 10, center_y + 7, 20, color) # flat face line
    oled.display.show()
```

The main loop of our game is easy to follow because it calls easy to understand function names.

```python
    oled.print("Touch when you", "see happy face") # show instructions at start
    sleep(3)

    while True:

        # Step 1: Start game
        start_game()
        sleep(uniform(2.0, 7.0)) # wait for random time between 2 and 7 seconds

        # Step 2: After a random time from 2 to 7 sec, switch to happy face with label Touch Now
        draw_face(happy=True, text_line_1="Touch now")
        start_time = ticks_ms()

        # Step 3: Wait for touch and show result or false start
        wait_for_touch()

        # Step 6: Wait 3 seconds, then show touch to play again
        sleep(3)
        show_touch_to_play_again()
```
