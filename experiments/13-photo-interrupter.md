# Photo Interrupter

![Photo Interrupter](/assets/images/circuits/Photo%20Interrupter%20Circuit.jpg)

A photo interrupter module sends infrared light beam from an emitter to a receiver (the two black blocks on the module), and detects when this beam is blocked. It is used to detect end-of-travel in 3D printers, CNC machines and robots. It is also used to count the pulses of a slotted disc rotating to calculate motor or wheel speed in robotics and smart cars. In a printer, it detects when a paper is present.

Create a new file in Thonny, with file name photo_interrupter.py. Copy and paste the code below into the file you created.

```python
print("\nPhoto Interrupter")

# DESCRIPTION

# A photo interrupter module sends infrared light beam from an emitter to a receiver 
# (the two black blocks on the module), and detects when this beam is blocked. 
# It is used to detect end-of-travel in 3D printers, CNC machines and robots. It is
# also used to count the pulses of a slotted disc rotating to calculate motor or wheel
# speed in robotics and smart cars. In a printer, it detects when a paper is present.

# CONNECTIONS REQUIRED

# Connect Photo Interrupter (KY-010) module (labeled 'IR Switch')
#   Pins: GND => GND, VCC => VCC, S => GP28
