# Knock Sensor

![Knock Sensor](/assets/images/circuits/Knock%20Sensor%20Circuit.jpg)

A knock sensor detects vibrations. This particular module uses a spring-based vibration switch. When the module is still, the spring does not touch the center pin, but when bumped or shaken, the spring sways and hits the center pin closing the circuit momentarily. For a ladder climbing robot, a knock sensor could detect when an extending arm hits a ladder rung, and then initiate next motion. While a crash sensor would need to be placed at the point of impact, a knock sensor could detect vibrations across an entire arm. To test, run the script, then hold the entire breadboard along with the knock sensor in hand, and give it a big skake bringing it to a sudden stop.

Create a new file in Thonny, with file name knock_sensor.py. Copy and paste the code below into the file you created.

```python
print("\nKnock Sensor")

# DESCRIPTION

# A knock sensor detects vibrations. This particular module uses a spring-based vibration switch.
# When the module is still, the spring does not touch the center pin, but when bumped or shaken,
# the spring sways and hits the center pin closing the circuit momentarily. For a ladder climbing robot, 
# a knock sensor could detect when an extending arm hits a ladder rung, and then initiate next motion.
# While a crash sensor would need to be placed at the point of impact, a knock sensor could detect 
# vibrations across an entire arm. To test, run the script, then hold the entire breadboard along with 
# the knock sensor in hand, and give it a big skake bringing it to a sudden stop.

# CONNECTIONS REQUIRED

# Connect Knock Sensor (KY-031) module 
# (labeled 'Digital Sensor' with an encased spring)
#   Pins: GND => GND, VCC => VCC, S => GP28
